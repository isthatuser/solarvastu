**Climate-Adapted Vaastu Shastra Guide for US Homes**

Ancient wisdom meets modern building science. SolarVastu adapts traditional Vaastu principles to your specific climate zone, providing practical, science-backed recommendations for home orientation and room placement.

## Features

- **Climate-Aware**: Different recommendations for Hot-Humid, Hot-Arid, Mixed, Cold, and Marine climates
- **Location Input**: Enter any major US city or coordinates
- **Building Science**: Each recommendation includes the reasoning behind it
- **US Architecture**: Adapted for American home styles (open floor plans, attached garages, etc.)

## Why SolarVastu?

Traditional Vaastu was developed for the Indian subcontinent. A south-facing home in Phoenix needs very different treatment than one in Seattle. SolarVastu recalibrates these ancient principles for:

- Your latitude's solar path
- Regional climate patterns
- Prevailing wind directions
- US building practices
